## Project Overview: Personal Health Data Analysis

While brainstorming project ideas, I recognized an opportunity to leverage my personal health data to better understand my daily habits and overall wellness. Apple Health provides comprehensive metrics such as heart rate, step count, and active energy burned, offering a rich dataset for exploration. This project aims to analyze these patterns to uncover correlations and gain insights into how various factors influence my overall health.

The primary motivation for this project is to identify relationships between physical activity, energy expenditure, and heart rate. By visualizing trends and correlations, I aim to better understand these dynamics while reinforcing the core concepts of the DSA210 course content. Integrating personal data with analytical methods offers a unique way to connect theory to real-world applications.

**Dataset Description:**

My dataset consist of below variables;
Step Counts: The number of steps recorded over specific time frames.
Heart Rates: Heart rate measurements across different activities and periods.
Active Energy Burned: Calories burned through physical activities.
These variables are recorded alongside timestamps, enabling an analysis of patterns across time.

**Project Goals:**

Uncover relationships between step counts, heart rate, and active energy burned.
Determine how these variables interact and influence one another.

Analyze the distribution of these metrics across different days of the week to identify daily patterns.
Explore trends across months of the year to uncover seasonal variations in physical activity and energy expenditure.
By combining visualization techniques with statistical analysis, this project aims to deliver meaningful insights into personal health patterns while applying concepts learned in the DSA210 course.
