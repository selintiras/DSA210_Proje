## Motivation

While considering a project idea, I realized the opportunity to analyze patterns within my personal health data to better understand my daily habits and overall wellness. Since Apple Health provides comprehensive data on metrics like heart rate, step count, and active energy burned, I decided to use this dataset for my analysis.

The motivation behind this project is to uncover correlations between my physical activity, energy expenditure, and heart rate to gain a deeper understanding of how these factors influence my overall health. By visualizing trends and identifying relationships, I wanted to gain a better understanding about DSA210 course content.
